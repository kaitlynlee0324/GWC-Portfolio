<br>
  
  <p1>Hi! My name is Kaitlyn and I am going to be a junior at Saratoga High School. I love to watch movies and travel. My favorite color is blue and I love dogs.</p1>

  <br>
  <p4>I created this game using Scratch. The goal of the game is to not touch the ghost. Every time you jump over the ghost youn earn a point. You also get bonus points if you jump up and touch the banana.</p4>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p5>Some similarities between Python and Scratch are that they both have loops and conditionals.Some differences are that in Scratch, the "code" is already prewritten whereas in Python, you have to create the "Scratch blocks" on your own by writing your own program.</p5>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p6>Learning how to write my own Python program was a bit confusing for me. At first, I didn't really understand the for loops, range, and if statements, but by the end of class I got a better understanding of it. I liked how we had more freedom to write our own programs. In Scratch, the blocks were already premade/written for us so we could only make the sprite do certain actions. In Python, we can code/program things to whatever we want it to do. However, I thought that learning the proper notations for Python were hard because things like capitalization, quotations, etc. affect the performance of your code.</p6>
